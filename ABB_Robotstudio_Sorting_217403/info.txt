in main function of controller 1 u can set what colour you want to pack.

in main function of controller 1 u can also set all_in_one and batsy true or false this leads to 3 modes:
1 both false
	it just packs selected colour

2 batsy true
	adds batman badge and puts the box on pedestal

3 all_in_one true
	packs all colours in order orange, blue, red, after each color is packed it auto resets enviroment

(both true => sets mode 3)
